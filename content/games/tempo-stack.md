**Tempo Stack** is an HTML5-based game where players control a moving block, with the objective of stacking each new block on top of the previous one. The block moves back and forth between two walls, changing directions when it hits a wall. Players must time their actions to stop the block at the right moment, aligning it precisely on top of the stack.

## How to Play

- **Objective**: The block moves back and forth, changing direction when it hits a wall. If the block is stacked correctly on top of the previous block, the next block is generated, and the process repeats.
- **Controls**:
  - **Desktop**: Press **ENTER** or **SPACE** to stop the block.
  - **Mobile**: Tap the screen to stop the block.
- **Scoring**: The score is based on the number of blocks successfully stacked. Each successfully placed block adds one point to the score. The game ends when the stack space is filled, or when a block fails to stack correctly.
